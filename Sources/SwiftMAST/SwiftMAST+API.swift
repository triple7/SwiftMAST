/** SwiftMAST common API calls
 These convenience functions allow quick access to some of the more interesting MAST API data requests.
 The MAST portal can be very complex to navigate, however most users would be looking to do the following investigations:
 * download calibrated scientific images of a chosen object in full spectrum
 * Find TESS candidates within a given cone search and download time series for analysis
 * Download the spectra of a given object in one of the available missions
 * Download 3D star mappings from the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) in CUBE format
 * Download GAIA point crossMatch parameters for conversion to 3D point cloud mapping
